- I learned that in Obsidian you can create documents that can later be pulled into a GitHub workflow.
- In VS code I learned how to integrate a Google Gemini API key into Roo Code, which then gave me many options to from the code reading my document or developing it. I could change from what lens the code processes it (architect, artist, code). 
- I also learned how to create subtasks from a parent task, detailing the steps easier and which more informational accuracy.
- Overall, I learned how to use Roo Code in VS Studio to create more logistical and clear documents from basic instructions.
